The schema of the experimental facility is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:facility}. CAEN V1751 10-bit digitizer with 1GHz sample rates is used for data taking \cite{CAENV1751}, which is controlled by a custom-made data acquisition (DAQ) software\footnote{Github repo: \url{https://github.com/greatofdream/CAENReadout}} based on CAEN library. The dynamic range of V1751 is \SI{1}{V} and \SI{1}{LSB} (Least Significant Byte) is about \SI{0.978}{mV}, which is defined as \SI{1}{ADC}. To handle the anomalous baseline larger than \SI{0}{V}, the offset of the digitizer is set to about \SI{0.183}{V}. Wiener EDS 30330p high voltage (HV) module \cite{WIENERHV} supplies a positive voltage for each PMT. The light source is a picosecond laser flashing system (PiL040XSM) from Advanced Laser Systems (A.L.S) \cite{NTKLaser}, which can produce short light pulses with a wavelength of \SI{405}{nm} and a width of \SI{34}{ps}. Besides, a period trigger signal output from the laser is connected to the digitizer, which serves as the trigger input. An attenuator is used to adjust the laser intensity. The HV and the laser are controlled by a computer using SNMP \cite{SNMP} and VISA \cite{VISA} protocol.

A black plastic box split into 4 grids with clapboards acts as a darkroom. A fiber splitter distributes attenuated light into 4 channels. Each grid holds a PMT and is equipped with an end of splitter channel, which is covered with a \SI{4}{cm\tothe{2}} square diffuser plate to diffuse the laser light into a small area and faces directly to the top of the PMT. Potted PMTs are connected from an integrated HV-signal decoupler in the PMT base to the HV module and digitizer with the HV lines and signal lines. Optical fibers and signal lines go through a hole with a diameter of \SI{0.5}{cm} on the box. Double-way connectors are used to connect HV lines through the box. Besides, CR365 PMT \cite{BJBS} from HAMAMATSU is used as a reference PMT with \SI{2.4}{ns} of TTS and 25\%@\SI{420}{nm} of quantum efficiency for design.
This work tested 9 MCP-PMTs in the testing system.

\subsection{Testing procedures}

    \label{fig:testingprocedure}
\end{figure}

The testing procedures are indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:testingprocedure}. All PMTs were measured under the HV provided by the vendor (NNVT). %, which has been calibrated at the gain of $1\times10^7$. 
The PMT-box map is stored as meta data which is mainly used for PDE and testing system calibration. To stabilize and reduce the influence of the dark noise, all PMTs stay in the darkroom with HV on for at least 12 hours before running of DAQ software. %Testing contains two stages: the first stage is the noise stage, in which PMTs work without laser and the digitizer is triggered periodly at 1kHz mainly for DCR calculation; the second stage is laser stage, in which 
The digitizer samples data with laser on and is triggered by the laser during the experiment. The waveforms are stored in ROOT files and analyzed with the custom-made software\footnote{Github repo: \url{https://github.com/greatofdream/pmtTest}}.
