    Jinping Neutrino Experiment plans to deploy a new type of 8-inch MCP-PMT with high photon detection efficiency for MeV-scale neutrino measurements. This work presents the characterization of the MCP-PMTs, including the photon detection efficiency, the charge resolution of the single photoelectron, the transition time spread, single photoelectron response, rates of dark counts and after pulses. We find a long tail in the charge distribution, and combined with the high photon detection efficiency, the overall energy resolution sees substantial improvements. Those results will be provided as the inputs to detector simulation and design. Our results show that the new PMT satisfies all the requirements of the Jinping Neutrino Experiment.
