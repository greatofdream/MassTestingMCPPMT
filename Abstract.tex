\begin{abstract}
The new type of 8-inch MCP-PMT with high photon detection efficiency (PDE) is to be used in Jinping Neutrino Experiment (JNE) for MeV-scaled neutrino measurements. This work presents the implemented testing procedures and the characteristics of a set of MCP-PMTs. Results of tests illustrate that charge distribution contains a long tail and PDE is about 30\%, which is obviously higher than usual PMT. Considering influence of charge distribution, the boost of PDE contributes to energy resolution in theory and the new type MCP-PMT is promised in the MeV-scaled neutrino experiment. All measured parameters can be used in the simulation for further research.
