The new type of HQE 8-inch MCP-PMTs are used in Jinping Neutrino Experiment of 500t for MeV-scaled neutrino measurements. The detection efficiency of PMTs is significant for resolution. This work presents the implemented testing procedure and the characteristics of a set of sample of PMTs. Result of this work illustrates that detection efficiency of testing PMTs are about 30\%, obviously higher than reference PMT.
