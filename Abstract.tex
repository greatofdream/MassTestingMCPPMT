\begin{abstract}
The new type of 8-inch MCP-PMT with high photon detection efficiency is to be used in Jinping Neutrino Experiment (JNE) for MeV-scaled neutrino measurements. This work presents the implemented testing procedures and the characteristics of a set of MCP-PMTs. Tests illustrate that the charge distribution of the PMTs contains a long tail while the photon detection efficiency is about 1.7 times higher than the reference PMT. Considering the influence of charge distribution, the boost of photon detection efficiency still contributes to the detector energy resolution in theory. The new type of MCP-PMT is promising in the MeV-scaled neutrino experiments. All measured parameters can be used in the simulation for further research.
