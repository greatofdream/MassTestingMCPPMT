    Jinping Neutrino Experiment plans to deploy a new type of 8-inch MCP-PMT with high photon detection efficiency for MeV-scale neutrino measurements. This work presents the characterization of the new MCP-PMTs, including the photon detection efficiency, the charge distribution, etc. We find a long tail in the charge distribution of a single photoelectron, but combined with the high photon detection efficiency, the overall energy resolution sees substantial improvements. Single photoelectron response, rates of dark counts and after pulses are also provided as the inputs to detector simulation and design. Our results show that this PMT satisfies all the requirements of the Jinping Neutrino Experiment.
