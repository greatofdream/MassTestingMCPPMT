\abstract{
The new type of HQE 8-inch MCP-PMTs are to be used in Jinping Neutrino Experiment for MeV-scaled neutrino measurements. The photon detection efficiency of PMT is significant for energy resolution. This work presents the implemented testing procedures and the characteristics of a set of MCP-PMTs. Results of tests illustrate that photon detection efficiency of tested MCP-PMTs are about 30\%, obviously higher than usual PMT. The boost of detection efficiency contributes to energy resolution in theory and the new type MCP-PMT is promised in MeV-scaled neutrino experiment. Those measured parameters can be used in the simulation for further researches.
