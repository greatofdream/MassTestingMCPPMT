\begin{abstract}
The new type of 8-inch MCP-PMT with high photon detection efficiency (PDE) is to be used in Jinping Neutrino Experiment (JNE) for MeV-scaled neutrino measurements. This work presents the implemented testing procedures and the characteristics of a set of MCP-PMTs. Tests illustrate that the charge distribution contains a long tail and PDE is about 1.7 times of CR365, which is higher than usual PMT. Considering the influence of charge distribution, the boost of PDE contributes to energy resolution in theory and the new type MCP-PMT is promising in the MeV-scaled neutrino experiment. All measured parameters can be used in the simulation for further research.
