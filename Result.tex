\section{Energy resolution boost}
\label{Result}
Assume the PE counts $N$ on a PMT with PDE $\epsilon$ for an event with visible energy $E$ obeys Poisson distribution $\pi(\lambda_N=K\epsilon E)$, where $K$ is a factor related to light yield and detector optics. The output total charge $\sum{Q}$ is a compound Poisson random variable with the expectation $\mathrm{E}[\sum{Q}]=\lambda_N\mathrm{E}[Q]$ and variance $\mathrm{Var}[\sum{Q}]=\mathrm{E}^2[Q]\lambda_N+\lambda_N\mathrm{Var}[Q]$. The energy is estimated as $\hat{E}=\sum{Q}/(K\epsilon\mathrm{E}[Q])$ with its resolution being

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[\hat{E}]}}{\mathrm{E}[\hat{E}]}=\frac{\sqrt{\mathrm{E}^2[Q]\lambda_N+\lambda_N\mathrm{Var}[Q]}}{\lambda_N\mathrm{E}[Q]}=\frac{\sqrt{1+\frac{\mathrm{Var}[Q]}{\mathrm{E}^2[Q]}}}{\sqrt{K\epsilon E}}.
\end{equation}

The PMT specific factors are $\epsilon$ (proportional to relative PDE $\epsilon^0$) and \(1 + \mathrm{Var}[Q]/ \mathrm{E}^2[Q]\) (estimated by the sample resolution $\nu^2$ in Section~\ref{sec:noisepeak}).  The latter is known as the \emph{excess noise factor}~\cite{JUNOMassTesting,ENF,ENFAuger} indicating the impact of single-PE charge smearing on energy.  We plot the \emph{figure of merit} $M_{E}\equiv\sqrt{({1+\nu^2})/{\epsilon^0}}$ of the reference and nine MCP-PMTs in Fig.~\ref{fig:EnergyResolution}. Despite the long tail in the charge distribution, the boost of PDE of MCP-PMTs leads to a 10\% better $M_{E}$.  Because of that, considering the long tail to be an undesired by-product of MCP coating to improve the collection efficiency, we decide to adopt the technology.  We are developing an advanced waveform analysis method to model the charge distribution and count PEs that may eliminate the long-tail degradation on energy resolution.
