\section{Summary}
\label{Summary}
The characteristics of 9 MCP-PMTs are measured in this work, which can be used for simulation and further research. A new calibration method for PDE is developed and the relative PDE of new type 8ich MCP PMT is significantly high and is about 1.7. Although the resolution of the total charge is worse, the ability for boosting energy resolution is promising.
