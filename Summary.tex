\section{Summary}
\label{Summary}
The characteristics of 9 MCP-PMTs are measured in this work, which can be used for simulation and further research. A new calibration method for PDE is developed and the expected relative PDE of new type 8-inch MCP-PMT is significantly high and is about 1.7 times of CR365. Although the resolution of the total charge is worse, the ability for boosting energy resolution is promising.
