Light source is a picosecond laser flashing system (PiL040XSM) from Advanced Laser Systems(A.L.S)\cite{NTKLaser}, which can produce short light pulses with a wavelenght of \SI{405}{nm} and a width of \SI{34}{ps}. The light is attenuated by a laser attenuator with 0.5-30db. A fiber splitter with the standard G.657.A1 distributes attenuated light into 4 channels, which face directly to the top of PMT.

The other end of the optical fibers were positioned in front of the PMT, illuminating the full cath-
ode. In order to yield SPE events as signal the laser intensity was adjusted to a level where only
about one out of 10 trigger signals led to a PMT signal. The average signal-to-trigger ratio was
RT = 9.95 % Â± 2.98 %, while the error was derived from the variation in the ratios of all PMTs. It
was not possible to adjust the light intensity at each PMT individually, as 30 PMTs were illumi-
nated by the same laser beam
