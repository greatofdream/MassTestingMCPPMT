\section{Testing setup and procedure}
As light source the beam of a 438 nm picosecond injection laser (PiLas) from Advanced Laser
Diode Systems was sent through a diffuser to a perforated plate with 30 optical fibers connected.
The other end of the optical fibers were positioned in front of the PMT, illuminating the full cath-
ode. In order to yield SPE events as signal the laser intensity was adjusted to a level where only
about one out of 10 trigger signals led to a PMT signal. The average signal-to-trigger ratio was
RT = 9.95 % Â± 2.98 %, while the error was derived from the variation in the ratios of all PMTs. It
was not possible to adjust the light intensity at each PMT individually, as 30 PMTs were illumi-
nated by the same laser beam
