\section{Introduction}
The Jinping Neutrino Experiment (JNE)\cite{} is a large-volume water based liquid scintillator experiment with \SI{700}{m} rock overburden. Its main goal is to accurately measure the spectrum of solar neutrino and discover solar neutrino upturn\cite{}. The energy resolution for low energy determines the details of energy spectrum of solar neutrino, which is dependent on the coverage of light collection and efficiency of photon detection.

Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) is the important instrument for detecting few photons in experiments, which transform photon signal to measurable electric signal. The spatial, timing resolution and furthermore energy resolution depend on the characteristics of PMTs, especially the quantum efficiency (QE). 

The 8-inch micro-channel plate PMTs(MCP-PMT) come from Northern Night Vision Technology Ltd.(NNVT), which will be used in JNE. Measurements for MCP-PMT were done by JUNO for 20-inch PMTs, which has similar structure with 8-inch PMT\cite{}.


The MCP of MCP-PMT is covered with \ce{Al2O3} to boost the collection efficiency. The electron generated from cathode hitting directly on the openings of the micro-channels is multiplied in electric field. The electron hitting on the surface of MCP will generate 1 or more electrons and those electrons will fall into the channel of MCP, going multiplying process.

There exist two MCP in the MCP-PMT. The electron amplified from first MCP hiting on second MCP. Due to the MCP has a threshold, the charge generate fromn eachb chanbnel will saturate. Therefore the total charge obeys multi-gaussian model.
