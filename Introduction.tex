\section{Introduction}
% Experiment Introduction and Importance of resolution for Low PE
The Jinping Neutrino Experiment (JNE) of multi-hundred-tons is a large-volume water-based liquid scintillator experiment with \SI{2400}{m} rock overburden \cite{LetterJNE2017} which is under construction. Its main goal is to accurately measure the spectrum of MeV-scale neutrinos, including solar neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, and supernova neutrinos \cite{LetterJNE2017}. % PMT Introduction
The photomultiplier tube (PMT) \cite{HAMAMATSUManual}, which transforms a photon into a single photoelectron (PE), and then to the measurable electric signal, is often used to detect few photons in water Cherenkov detectors \cite{SNO,SuperK} and liquid scintillator detectors \cite{KamLAND,JUNO:2015zny}. The details of the energy spectrum of neutrinos of low energy are determined by the energy resolution, which is dependent on the coverage of light collection and photon detection efficiency of PMTs. The price of PMTs also plays an important role for the coverage of light collection during design. The direction information from Cherenkov photons, which is centered in less than \SI{1}{ns} for electrons less than \SI{30}{MeV}, provides the ability to suppress the background in the solar neutrinos and supernova relic neutrinos measurements for the Cherenkov scintillation detector \cite{Guo_2019}. The short time scale of Cherenkov light requires the deviation of transit time to be less than \SI{1}{ns} considering the uncertainty of about \SI{1.3}{ns} for \SI{10}{m} scale detectors from the dispersion\footnote{The uncertainty from dispersion is estimated as $R\frac{\delta\lambda}{\lambda^2}$, in which $R$, $\delta\lambda$, and $\lambda$ are about \SI{10}{m}, \SI{5}{mm/ns} and \SI{195}{mm/ns} \cite{Luo:2022xrd}.} is the main component.

Instead of conventional discrete dynodes, the micro-channel plate (MCP) PMT use MCP to multiply electron from photocathode inside the micro-channels, which offer faster time response and high gain in a compact size \cite{HAMAMATSUManual}. The new type of 8-inch MCP-PMT (GDB-6082 \cite{GDB-6082}) meeting above requirements including good cost performance, which produced by North Night Vision Science \& Technology (Nanjing) Research Institute Co. Ltd. (NNVT), will be used in JNE. The new type of MCP-PMTs have high photon detection efficiency, which is the product of collection efficiency and quantum efficiency. This work is to confirm the superiority of photon detection efficiency (PDE) and boost on energy resolution of the new type of MCP-PMT. This also is the first measurement for the new type of 8-inch MCP-PMT.

% Testing of Other Experiments
Measurements for the 20-inch MCP-PMT from NNVT, which has a similar structure to 8-inch MCP-PMT, were done by JUNO and confirmed that the average PDE is about 28\% \cite{JUNOMassTesting}. In addition, several other recent PMT characterization tests were reviewed and referenced. Gain, single PE resolution, PDE, transit time spread (TTS), and dark count rate (DCR) are the most important parameters measured in recent different experiments. For example, Daya Bay used 8-inch dynode PMTs (9354KB, R5912, XP1806) \cite{DayaBayTesting}, Double Chooze used 10-inch dynode PMTs (R7081) \cite{DoubleChoozeTesting}, LHAASO used 8-inch dynode PMTs (CR365-02-1) \cite{LHAASOTesting}, HyperKamiokande tested 20-inch dynode PMT (R12860) and MCP-PMT (GDB-6203) \cite{HyperKTesting}, KM3Net used 3-inch dynode PMT(R12199-02) \cite{KM3NetTesting}, XENON1T and XENONnT tested 3-inch dynode PMT (R11410-21) \cite{XENON1TTesting}\cite{XENONnTTesting}, IceCube tested 3-inch PMT (R12199-01) \cite{IceCubeTesting}.
