\section{Introduction}
% Experiment Introduction and Importance of resolution for Low PE
The Jinping Neutrino Experiment under construction is a hundred-ton liquid scintillator detector with dual Cherenkov and scintillation light readout
 at CJPL II with 2400m rock overburden, targeting solar, terrestrial and supernovae neutrinos \cite{LetterJNE2017}. % PMT Introduction
The photomultiplier tube (PMT) \cite{HAMAMATSUManual}, which transforms a photon into a single photoelectron (PE), and then to the measurable electric signal, is mostly used to detect few photons in water Cherenkov detectors \cite{SNO,SuperK} and liquid scintillator detectors \cite{KamLAND,JUNO:2015zny}. Instead of conventional discrete dynodes, the micro-channel plate (MCP) PMT multiply photoelectron inside the micro-channels of MCP, which offers faster time response and high gain in a compact size \cite{HAMAMATSUManual}.

Precise energy spectra resolution demands affordable PMTs to achieve good photo-coverage with high photon detection efficiency (PDE\footnote{the product of collection efficiency and quantum efficiency}). The direction information from Cherenkov photons provides the ability to do solar angle cut selection in the solar neutrinos measurements for the Cherenkov scintillation detector \cite{Guo_2019}. Considering the spectrum of Cherenkov photons \cite{Luo:2022xrd}, the uncertainty of Cherenkov photons time from dispersion is about \SI{1.5}{ns} for \SI{10}{m} scale detectors, which loosely limits the deviation of transit time to be at the scale of \SI{1}{ns}.

The new type of 8-inch MCP-PMT (GDB-6082 \cite{GDB-6082}) produced by North Night Vision Science \& Technology (Nanjing) Research Institute Co. Ltd. (NNVT) meets above requirements including good cost performance, high PDE, and good transit time spread (TTS). This work is the first measurement for the new type of PMTs to confirm the superiority of PDE and boost on energy resolution of the new type of MCP-PMTs.

% Testing of Other Experiments
Measurements for the 20-inch MCP-PMT from NNVT, which has a similar structure to 8-inch MCP-PMT, were done by JUNO and confirmed that the average PDE is about 28\% \cite{JUNOMassTesting}. In addition, several other recent PMT characterization tests were reviewed and referenced. Gain, single PE resolution, PDE, TTS, and dark count rate (DCR) are the most important parameters measured in recent different experiments. For example, Daya Bay tested 8-inch dynode PMTs (9354KB, R5912, XP1806) \cite{DayaBayTesting}, Double Chooze used 10-inch dynode PMTs (R7081) \cite{DoubleChoozeTesting}, LHAASO used 8-inch dynode PMTs (CR365-02-1) \cite{LHAASOTesting}, HyperKamiokande tested 20-inch dynode PMTs (R12860) and MCP-PMTs (GDB-6203) \cite{HyperKTesting}, KM3Net used 3-inch dynode PMTs (R12199-02) \cite{KM3NetTesting}, XENON1T and XENONnT tested 3-inch dynode PMTs (R11410-21) \cite{XENON1TTesting}\cite{XENONnTTesting}, IceCube tested 3-inch PMTs (R12199-01) \cite{IceCubeTesting}.

% The structure of paper
This work concentrated on the characteristics of MCP-PMTs in the low photon intensity condition. The setup of the testing system and facility is introduced in sec.~\ref{SetUp}. Detailed analysis methods and results, including Gain, single PE resolution, PDE, TTS, DCR, time characteristics of single electron response (SER), pre-pulse, and after-pulse are described in sec.~\ref{Method}. The boost for energy resolution is discussed in sec.~\ref{Result}. Finally, a summary is given in sec.~\ref{Summary}.
